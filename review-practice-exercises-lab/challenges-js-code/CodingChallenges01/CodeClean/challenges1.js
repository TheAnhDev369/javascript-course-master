/**
   Coding Challenge #1
   Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
   calculated using the formula:
   BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
   and height in meter).
   Your tasks:
   1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
   2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
   versions)
   3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
   whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
   Test data:
   ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
   m tall.
   ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
   m tall.
   GOOD LUCK !
